Innovative Idea: 
Our project idea is to create a second-hand trading platform on campus, where students can post the second-hand items they don’t use on the platform and buy what they need. 
We get some inspiration from Mercari, the application is used to trading second-hand items. However, the trading scope covers the whole United States, which means if we want to sell or buy the item, we still need to pay for postage. It is not worthwhile, and I found some friends of mine in UMass also want to sell their second-hand item, but they are suffering from not finding a place to post. They just can post it on Facebook, but the probability of selling on Facebook is extremely low because no one sees. As a result, we decided to develop the application for the trading scope just to cover UMass. The application will make buyers and sellers more cost-effective(do not need to pay postage) and will make students’ life become more convenient.
